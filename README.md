The Key Professional Dataset project aims to develop a comprehensive intelligence platform for institutional asset management distribution. The project seeks to establish a centralized repository for profiles of consultants, investors, and managers, incorporating key professional contact information sourced from public platforms like Reddit, LinkedIn and Instagram

The project involves designing and implementing a Web Crawler using Python to extract publicly available professional data, leveraging MySQL or other open-source relational databases for data organization and conducting quantitative analysis using PowerBI and Tableau.
